# Dart Index Out of Bounds Exception

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: the "IndexOutOfRangeException".  The `bug.dart` file contains code that attempts to access an element in a list using an index that is greater than or equal to the list's length. This results in a runtime exception.

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version of the code, including error handling to prevent the exception.

This example highlights the importance of input validation and careful index management when working with lists in Dart.
